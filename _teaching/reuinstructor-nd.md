I designed and ran a shortened version of the Scientific Writing for Physicists course offered through the department. This course was aimed at the Research Experience for Undergraduates students that were visiting for the summer. Key concepts covered include planning and drafting tools/methods, principles of storytelling for science, and how to make effective figures and tables. I also introduced the students to LaTeX and produced a template for the students to use for their final report.

The syllabus for the class can be found [here](https://charlottewood.me/files/syllabus_reu_summer2021.pdf).
