The Physics Teaching Practicum is a class designed to provide graduate students with teaching/lecture experience. For the Practicum, I gave five lectures (four under supervision) and put together a portfolio of my materials, feedback, and reflections.

Classes covered:
======
* Physics of Astrophysics (one lecture)
  * Advanced astronomy course for senior physics majors and first/second-year graduate students

* Introduction to Astrophysics (three lectures)
  * Introductory astronomy course for sophomore physics majors

* Elementary Cosmology (one lecture)
  * Introductory astronomy course for freshman non-science majors
