The Physics Teaching Practicum is a class designed to provide graduate students with teaching/lecture experience. For the Practicum, I gave six lectures (five under observation; two more upcoming) and put together a portfolio of my materials, feedback, and reflections. I also have a recording of my Scientific Writing lecture as it was done over Zoom.

Classes covered:
======
* Descriptive Astronomy/Elementary Cosmology (one lecture - one upcoming)
  * Introductory astronomy courses for freshman non-science majors
* Introduction to Astrophysics (three lectures)
  * Introductory astronomy course for sophomore physics majors
* Physics of Astrophysics (one lecture)
  * Advanced astronomy course for senior physics majors and first/second-year graduate students
* Modern Observational Techniques (one or two lectures - upcoming)
  * Advanced astronomy course for senior physics majors and first/second-year graduate students
* Scientific Writing (one lecture)
  * Graduate education course for graduate students at any stage
