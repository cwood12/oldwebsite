* Modern Observational Techniques (Fall 2019)
  * Advanced astronomy methods course for senior physics majors and first/second-year graduate students. I assisted with creating answer keys and grading homework assignments, as well as answering student's questions about assignments.

* Descriptive Astronomy (Fall 2016, Fall 2017 - present)
  * Introductory astronomy course for non-science majors, includes a lecture component and an observatory component. I was the lead teaching assistant for this course (Fall 2017 - Spring 2019). My responsibilities included setting the observatory hours and nightly schedule for the TAs, distributing the grading, and helping rewrite the observatory projects. At the observatory, I set up telescopes for the current projects and assist students with any questions they have. I have also helped with grading and proctoring exams.

* Physics of Astrophyics (Fall 2018)
  * Advanced astronomy course for senior physics majors and first/second-year graduate students. I assisted with grading homework assignments and answering student's questions. I also covered one lecture (see [Physics Teaching Practicum](https://charlottewood.me/teaching/practicum_2018-2019)) while the professor was traveling.

* Lasers & Modern Optics (Spring 2017)
  * Advanced lecture/labratory physics course for junior/senior physics majors. I assisted with setting up and testing the optics labs, answering student questions and troubleshooting during the labs, and grading lab reports.
