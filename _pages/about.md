Hi! I'm Charlotte and I'm currently a fifth year graduate student at the University of Notre Dame, studying astrophysics under Peter Garnavich. My research focuses on light echoes around type Ia supernovae and what they can tell us about the stellar systems that create these explosions. Other research interests of mine include gravitational wave counterparts, white dwarfs (particularly those in binary systems), and brown dwarfs. 

I got my Bachelor of Science in Physics (plus a minor in astronomy) at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY, graduated in 2016. There I worked with Stephen Lawrence studying light echoes around recurrent novae, as well as the light echo around SN 1987A. I also participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at the University of Oklahoma where I worked with Mukremin Kilic studying extremely low mass white dwarfs. I started as a graduate student in the summer of 2016 and completed candidacy in April 2020 to receive my Masters and officially become a PhD candidate.

At Notre Dame, I am heavily involved with the Graduate Physics Society, a graduate student-run organization in the department that provides resources to foster community between students in across all subfields and to fill gaps in their professional skills. I am also involved with the local chapter of the Association for Women in Physics as the department representative and I participate in many of the astronomy-related outreach opportunities, such as public observing events & lectures and running science craft workshops for school children.

Outside of physics, I enjoy horseback riding, photography (including astrophotography), playing pool, traveling, and hanging out with my fiance & dog. I grew up in North Carolina so I'm a big UNC basketball fan and I enjoy going to Notre Dame football, basketball, and hockey games when I have time.

If you have any questions about my research, graduate school (general or at ND specifically), outreach, or if you just want to say hi, please contact me! My contact info for various platforms is shown on the left.
