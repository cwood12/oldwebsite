Hi! I'm Charlotte and I'm currently a sixth year graduate student at the University of Notre Dame, studying astrophysics under Peter Garnavich. I will be starting as the Astronomy & Astrophysics Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at Iowa State University in the Fall! My research focuses on understanding type Ia supernova variations and what effects they have on the Hubble constant measurement. Other research interests of mine include light echoes, white dwarf stars, brown dwarfs, scientific writing/communication, and physics education.

I got my Bachelor of Science in Physics (plus a minor in astronomy) at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY, graduated in 2016. There I worked with Stephen Lawrence studying light echoes around recurrent novae, as well as the light echo around SN 1987A. I also participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at the University of Oklahoma where I worked with Mukremin Kilic studying extremely low mass white dwarfs. I started as a graduate student in the summer of 2016 and completed candidacy in April 2020 to receive my Masters and officially become a PhD candidate.

At Notre Dame, I am heavily involved with the Graduate Physics Society, a graduate student-run organization in the department that provides resources to foster community between students in across all subfields and to fill gaps in their professional skills. I've participated in & helped organize many of the astronomy-related outreach activities on or near campus, such as public observing nights and science demos. Recently, I've been focusing on my scientific writing and I currently work as the writing consultant for the department.

Outside of physics, I enjoy horseback riding, photography (including astrophotography), playing pool, traveling (when there is not a global pandemic), and hanging out with my husband, [Patrick Fasano](https://www.patrickfasano.com) & dog, [Bentley](https://www.instagram.com/bentleythebeabull). I grew up in North Carolina so I'm a big UNC basketball fan and I enjoy going to Notre Dame football, basketball, and hockey games when I have time.

If you have any questions about my research, graduate school (general or at ND specifically), outreach, if you're hiring or know someone who is, or if you just want to say hi, please contact me! My contact info for various platforms is shown on the left.
