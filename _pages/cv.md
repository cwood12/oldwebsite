Other Research Experience
======
* Observing Experience
  * Large Binocular Telescope: 40+ nights, LBC photometry, MODS longslit & multislit spectroscopy, LUCI spectroscopy, PEPSI spectroscopy
  * W. M. Keck Observatory: Keck I & II, two 1/2 nights, DEIMOS & LRIS spectroscopy
  * Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory: 0.8m telescope, 3 nights, photometry

* Research Experience for Undergraduates
  * University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA
  * Summary of work: We searched for evidence of debris disks around extremely low mass white dwarfs as a potential explanation for an excess of calcium in the atmosphere of the white dwarfs. After looking at 22 targets, we found evidence of one possible disk, but more infrared observations are needed to confirm.
  * Advisor: Dr. Mukremin Kilic

* Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, USA
  * Summary of work: We used Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy to study the expanding remnants of T Pyxidis and V595 Monocerotis.
  * Advisor: Dr. Stephen S. Lawrence
