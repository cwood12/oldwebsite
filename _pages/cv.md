Other Research Experience
======
* Summer 2015: Research Experience for Undergraduates
  * University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA
  * Summary of work: We searched for evidence of debris disks around extremely low mass white dwarfs as a potential explanation for an excess of calcium in the atmosphere of the white dwarfs. After looking at 22 targets, we found evidence of one possible disk, but more infrared observations are needed to confirm.
  * Advisor: Dr. Mukremin Kilic

* Fall 2014 - Fall 2015: Research Assistant
  * Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, USA
  * Summary of work: We used Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy to study the expanding remnants of T Pyxidis and V595 Monocerotis. We also observed for three nights on the 0.8m telescope at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory to study the light echo of Supernova 1987A.
  * Advisor: Dr. Stephen S. Lawrence
