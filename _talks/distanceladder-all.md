While type Ia supernovae are powerful tools for measuring the Hubble constant, they are not perfectly standard candles and require corrections to make them standard. We aim to constrain the systematic uncertainties on estimations of the Hubble constant due to type Ia supernova variations by comparing type Ia supernovae with distances calibrated through infrared surface brightness fluctuations (which target supernovae in older, elliptical galaxies) and supernovae with distances calibrated through Cepheid variables (which target supernovae in younger, spiral galaxies). The two populations of supernovae are quite different observationally, so we re-estimate the Hubble constant using different subsamples of the supernovae (e.g, only those in Cepheid-calibrated galaxies or only those in SBF-calibrated galaxies) and look at how different the values can be.
