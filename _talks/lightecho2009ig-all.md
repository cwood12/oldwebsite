The light echo around Supernova 2009ig (SN2009ig) is the sixth known and most luminous around a type Ia supernova. Light echoes can provide information on the local environment around supernovae, which is particularly important for SNe Ia since they are used as standard candles. The presence of gas and dust in the local environment of SNe Ia can affect the observed luminosity and could impact measurements of the Hubble constant. Using photometric data from the Large Binocular Telescope between 2010 and 2018, we present new observations of the SN2009ig light echo that confirm a slow fading of the echo over the past 6 years since its discovery in 2013. The fading is similar to that seen in the light echo of SN1991T and suggests that some of dust producing the echo may be local to the event.

A PDF of the presentation will be available after Feb. 25, 2019.
