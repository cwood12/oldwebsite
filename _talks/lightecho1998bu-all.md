Supernova 1998bu is one of seven known type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with a light echo. Like several other SNe Ia with light echoes, SN 1998bu declined slower than normal SNe Ia, suggesting that its peak brightness is slightly over-luminous. However unlike other SNe Ia with light echoes, SN 1998bu has colors indicating significant foreground extinction. Light echoes are the result of photons scattering off dust into our line of sight and Hubble Space Telescope imaging of SN 1998bu revealed both a compact inner echo and a resolved outer echo. Here we present the evolution of both the inner and outer echoes of SN 1998bu using four epochs of HST data from 2000 to 2015. The existence of the inner echo and its behavior over time suggest that there is a local dust cloud around SN 1998bu that may be related to the progenitor system, while the rapid expansion of the outer echo helps map the dust in the spiral arm of NGC 3368 (M96) where SN 1998bu is located.
