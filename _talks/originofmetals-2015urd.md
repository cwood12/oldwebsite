Extremely low mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs) are helium WDs characterized by mass \\(\\leq 0.25 \\rm M\_{\\odot}\\) or surface gravity \\(5.0 < \\log{g} < 7.0\\). All ELM WDs found to date must have been formed in tight binary systems (P < 1 day) as the age of the universe is not large enough to form such small WDs through single-star evolution. The spectra of all ELM WDs with surface gravity \\(\\log{g} < 6.0\\) show a Ca-K (3933 angstroms) absorption line, indicating calcium concentrations of up to \\(\\rm Ca/H = 10^{-5}\\). In their higher mass counterparts, the presence of calcium is explained by active accretion onto the WD from a circumstellar debris disk. It is suspected that the same process could explain the presence of calcium in ELM WDs, however such a disk would have to be circumbinary. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC 1 & 2 combined with archival data from GALEX, SDSS, WISE, 2MASS, and UKIDSS, we observed 22 ELM WDs with Ca-K absorption features. After fitting model spectra and adding disk models, we find one ELM WD (J2132+0754) with a statistically significant infrared excess that could be explained by circumbinary disk.
